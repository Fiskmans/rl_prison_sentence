# Prison Sentence
This plugin allows you to set daily, weekly, or monthly goals for a boss and gives you an infobox with progress towards your goal until you reach it.

When you first install the plugin it will mark down the time and date in your settings but you have to manually set the amount you had when you started for the plugin to work correctly.

Note, Any extra progress will overflow into the next period
